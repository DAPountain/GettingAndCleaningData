run_analysis.R details
====================

The run_analysis.R script contains the R commands to extract the required output from  the supplied input.

There are 5 high level steps detailed in this script, corresponding to the requirements listed below (original source: course project description)

1) Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
